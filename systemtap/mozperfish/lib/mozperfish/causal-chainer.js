/**
 * Process the mozperfish JSON blob to establish causal chains.  The goal is to
 *  assign every event-loop event to a containing a causal chain.
 *
 * Chains are established and linked by trace events that will cause a future
 *  event loop event to execute and the trace events that are the execution
 *  of that promised future event.  Chains may form graphs if a 'chain' causes
 *  multiple outstanding events to exist concurrently.
 *
 * For example, code 'foo' may issue an asynchronous database query which will
 *  trigger a callback.  If the active event for 'foo' terminates without
 *  scheduling any other events, we observe events for the execution of the
 *  asynchronous database execution, and then witness the scheduling and
 *  execution of the callback for 'foo', we can link them all together in
 *  a single causal chain.  In contrast, if code 'bar' were to issue two
 *  asynchronous queries with callbacks, we would perceive that as the splitting
 *  of the chain.  If one of the callbacks were to terminate without scheduling
 *  another future event, we can attempt to model that as the chains merging
 *  back into a single chain.
