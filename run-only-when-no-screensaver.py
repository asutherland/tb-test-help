# A simple script to use dbus to check the state of the screensaver that starts
#  a subprocess when the screensaver deactivates and kills the subprocess when
#  the screensaver activates.
#
# Assuming you lock your computer for peace of mind, this helps out your peace
#  of mind by letting you only run security-compromising things when you are
#  at your keyboard.  (Or if you are not at your keyboard and forget to lock
#  and you ahve no auto-lock, you're certainly no worse off.)
#
# We also restart dead processes periodically if they go away.
#
# To kill the child process we send it a SIGTERM and follow that up after
#  a second with a SIGKILL if it did not die from the SIGTERM.  We are not
#  killer robots from the future, though, so we can be outwitted.  If you are
#  using a shell script as a fancy alias, you can simplify things by using
#  "exec" in the shell script to have the shell replaced with the executable.
#
# For example, you could use this to run an SSH port forwarding mechanism that
#  exposes potentially private data on the machine running the script to another
#  machine that you are less paranoid about.  (Obviously, nothing stops the
#  other machine from getting compromised and then used to do evil once the
#  port forwarding mechanism reconnects, but I'm assuming that's not the most
#  important concern.)
